# Memory Game

### About
The game board consists of sixteen "tiles" arranged in a grid. Eight different pairs of tiles constitute these sixteen tiles, each with different symbols on one side. These tiles are shuffled randomly and flipped down when the game starts. 

### Game Rule
Flip any two hidden cards at one time to find out which ones match. Continue until you match all the eight pairs.
